# Wind-Turbine

Task

A wind turbine has 100 items on it, each gets inspected. Write an application that outputs numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three print “Coating Damage” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Lightning Strike” instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “Coating Damage and Lightning Strike” instead of the number.
The code to generate the output should be done in PHP and the output should be rendered in HTML with a nice user experience. 

Notes

Html should display data as a simple table with the part number and the inspection status (either the number or damage as described above). Table will be populated with data retrieved from php using JQuery.
A simple stylesheet will format the table for a more visually appealing user experience.
Php file to generate sample data. This could be altered to retrieve data from a database. Data stored as an array with structure (("id":1,"status":1),("id":2,"status":2),...)
